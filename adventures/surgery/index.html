<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between interior parts of a 1975 Eldorado Coupe and a Convertible?</p>
<p>Thankfully, the answer is &ldquo;not a lot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.houseofcadillacs.com/">Stephan&rsquo;s</a> incredible generosity, the non-original interior from his recently acquired parts hardtop coupe (&quot;<a href="http://www.houseofcadillacs.com/cars/75eldobeater/">The Big Blue Beater</a>&quot;) has been transplanted into my 1975 Convertible. So,I have gone fron an Antique Light Blue interior to a dark blue non-original interior.  It is quite can improvement over my dramatically rotting seats which I refused to spend over $1500 to re-cover.  I am doing psuedo-restoration on the cheap, and this was a great opportunity to reduce the suckage of the interior (at the cost of originality).</p>
<p>I arrived around in Walnut Creek at 9AM after a 60 mile drive rocketing up 680 from San Jose with the top down on a cool September morning in Northern California.  Cranking up the tunes in my 1978 nonoriginal GM 8-track with rotting non-10 Ohm speakers.  No, this car will win no award, but the low-fidelity tunes with the wind in my thinning hair made me smile the whole way.</p>
<p>We presumed we could easily do this jon in 3 hours, maybe 4.  I had a hard stop at 3:00PM (a school dinner commitment), but would easily leave by 2. Fool!  Fool, fool, fool!  :-)</p>
<p>We jumped to work.  We hauled the new seats and carpet out to the driveway and went to work.  We removed the rear seat and the 4 big Torx bolts and then muscled out the 16 nuts and 16 bolts holding in the front seats.  We discovered the trick to removing the handles on the back of the seat (The plastic INSERT pops out!).  We moved my old handles to the new seats so Stephan could preserve the original orange-plaid handles under the re-covering material (He has a <a href="http://www.houseofcadillacs.com/cars/mandarin/">Mandarin Orange 1975 Eldorado Convertible</a>).  We then pulled the matching recover material off that handle to cover my old ones.  The morning was spent pulling out the seats and carpet, and laying in the new carpet.  The holes all matched!  I also found that because of the water invasion through my leaky top, the power seat cables were hopelessly corroded.  Thankfully, Stephan had an extra (surprise!).</p>
<p>The work was quite a sight - Stephan&rsquo;s neighbors wondered aloud at him if he got another parts car.  Some neighbors stopped by to chat, offer support and help.  It was something of a mechanical barn-raising :-)</p>
<p>My favorite tool:  The electric screwdriver.  Don&rsquo;t leave the garage without one!</p>
<p>We had a wonderful lunch of greek food (Thanke Janine!) and I got friendly with the Kozanda Greyhounds.  Well, at least their girl, Rocket, who was such a sweetie.  The boy dog was a bit more timid and I didn&rsquo;t really get to meet him much.  But those dogs were really cute and a lot of fun to habve lunch around.  I suppose Rocket was more interested in the Gyro than me, but she was still cute.</p>
<p>We then started the install process after lunch.  Two hours to go, what can go wrorng?</p>
<p>We then learned to Cosmic Rule of Four.  If you have FOUR things to do, THREE will be effortless and ONE will suck.</p>
<p>Evidence:<br>
The seats are 4 parts:  2 50-50 parts, a back, and a bottom.  All went in except the passenger side, whic sat too high.  Looking at it, we saw that there were PLATES spot welded under the seats on the 4 mounting points for no apparent reason.</p>
<p>3 of the 4 plates came off with a hammer and chisel (screwdriver).  The 4th needed earnest hacksawing.  Why would you spot weld metal spacers under a seat?  Anyone?  Once we got off the 4 plates, the seat went in.</p>
<p>I had in my stash 3 of the 4 seat belt assembles for the darker blue color. The 4th was inexplicably missing from my stash, so I have one mismatched seat belt in light blue. :-(</p>
<p>So then we went on:</p>
<p>The door panels went on nicely from the coupe - for the front.  Some of the screws did not punch through the aftermarket covering, and we had to fuss with that a lot (Maybe 3 of the 4 worked!!).  So the doors are a dark blue and look pretty nice.</p>
<p>The carpet from the coupe fit in well.  It was one piece instead of two, which made it fussier to install, but we got it in.  It was pretty stained, but cleaned up pretty well after 15 quality minutes with a carpet cleaner. Miraculously, all of the existing carpet holes lined up.  We were able to route all of the wires with minimal hassle.</p>
<p>The rear seat fit, albeit snugly (as I was told it would).  The panels were a no go - since the convertible has window controls, the top opening was too small and there was NO opening for the courtesy light (since the cope has it overhead).  Stephan gave me the panels, I will try to strip off the covering and re-glue it to my existing panels.  Similarly, the upper-panel pads are differently sized, and I hope to uncover those as well and re-use the material to cover the convertible upper-panel pads.</p>
<p>We raced against the clock to install the last of the parts and as I went to leave the seat belt buzzer failed to shut off.  We never connected the wires.  After a mad dash to try to fix it (I was already late) Stephan suggested that disassembling the lower dash and removing the buzzer would be faster.  So we did!  Quickly.  We pulled the buzzer, and now I need to fix all of the wiring to that the automatic seat releases and seat belt alerts work properly.  The power seats do!</p>
<p>On the way we have dozens of mismatched screws, missing holes, things that didn&rsquo;t quite fit and parts that were not what we hoped.  But in the end, the inside of my car looks MUCH better and FEELS better to sit in, too!</p>
<p>I left at 3:30 - 30 minutes past my absolute drop-dead departure time.  I rudely left Stephan with an awesomely bad mess in his driveway, and I felt bad about that (Sorry, Stephan!), but I felt even worse about the possibility of failing to meet my commitment at home.</p>
<p>I completed the drive home, top down and top speed, in record time. Cranking the tunes, getting burned by the relentless autumn sun.  Smiling. Woohoo!</p>
<p>I love my new interior seats.  Thanks Stephan and Janine!  I also dumped most of my parts stash on Stephan.  I so rarely work on my car that there is no point for me to have them.  Working on a car has become a social event for me, so I&rsquo;m sure the next time I need a part I will drive out to Walnut Creek again for another mechanical play date.</p>
<p>Stephan should be posting photos on House of Cadillacs soon.  I will need to fine tune the installed bits, but the mismatched, non-orginal, non-convertible, incorrectly colored seats are just TONS better than what I had.</p>
<p>Did I mention that I&rsquo;m smiling?</p>
<p>Stephan has published a <a href="http://houseofcadillacs.com/cars/75eldobeater/Interior/index.html">photo essay</a> of the project.</p>
