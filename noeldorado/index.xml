      <description>For 2005, I got the crazy idea to add MORE lights to the Cadillac. With around 300 mini lights, My tired old WalMart Inverter struggled mightily under the load. When the car idled, the lights went din, or whout off altogether. The whole set would randomly shut down.
At work, I complained to my friend Rick who nodded patiently and empathtically at my predicament.
The next morning, he dropped off a giant 300W inverter with long tail of 10 gauge silvered wire terminated with endpoints designed for direct car battery connection.</description>

      <description>This Christmas for the first time in a few years, I was not traveling. My kids, 6 and 8, are into the holiday decorating. We did the tree and the house, but something was missing.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to decorate the 1975 Eldorado Convertible with Christmas lights ever since I got it. I even pictured in my mind what it looked like. It just BEGS to be driven, with the top down, surrounded in lights.</description>
